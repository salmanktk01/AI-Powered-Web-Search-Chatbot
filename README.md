# Search-Engine
This project enables users to engage with an intelligent chatbot capable of searching the web, retrieving information from Arxiv, Wikipedia, and conducting general web searches through DuckDuckGo. Powered by Groq's Gemma2-9b-it model, the chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing to generate contextually relevant responses based on real-time search results. It allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive answers instantly. The chatbot can perform web searches, retrieve academic papers from Arxiv, and provide detailed explanations from Wikipedia, making it a versatile tool for both research and general knowledge inquiries. Additionally, the system is customizable, allowing users to configure the Groq API key and adjust the chatbot's behavior via an intuitive sidebar. This integration combines cutting-edge technologies like LangChain, Groq API, and Streamlit to create a seamless experience, making it easier for users to access and interact with diverse sources of information.
